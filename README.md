[![License: AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0)

## Description

My QOL Scripts (MQS) is a powerful, client-side Minecraft mod that provides a highly flexible and modern JavaScript API for creating complex scripts and macros. It is built from the ground up to offer superior performance and capabilities compared to alternatives.

## Features

*   **Modern JavaScript:** Write your scripts using the latest features from ECMAScript 2024, powered by GraalVM.
*   **Robust Class Extension:** Extend Minecraft's own classes directly in your JavaScript code, allowing for true object-oriented scripting.
*   **Yarn Mappings:** Write scripts that don't break between Minecraft updates. Your code uses stable Yarn names, and MQS handles the mapping to obfuscated names automatically.
*   **High Performance:** A highly optimized engine ensures your scripts run efficiently without lagging your game.

## Installation

1.  Download the latest release from the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/trethore/MQS/releases).
2.  Drop the downloaded `.jar` file into the `mods` folder of your Minecraft instance.
3.  Ensure you have Fabric API installed.

## Usage

1.  Run Minecraft with the mod installed once to generate the necessary folders.
2.  Place your JavaScript files (`.js`) inside the scripts folder located at `.minecraft/my-qol-scripts/scripts/`.
3.  The mod will load your scripts, and you can run them in-game (see the documentation for creating commands and keybinds).
